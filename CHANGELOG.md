## Version 1.2 (January 18, 2016)

* It's no longer necessary to restart the gadget after
  running Win7WeatherGadgetRepairTool.bat.  (Thanks to
  Chris for the suggestion to restart sidebar.exe).


## Version 1.1 (November 8, 2015)

* The application will refuse to run on anything other than
  Windows 7.  This application was designed specifically
  and solely for Windows 7.  The uninstaller will still run
  on other versions of Windows because it's possible that
  the machine was upgraded to a newer version of Windows
  after the application was installed.

* If the repair fails, the window will stay open because the
  application will pause rather than run through to completion.
  The user will be presented with a "press any key to continue"
  message.  After pressing a key, the window will close.


## Version 1.0 (November 8, 2015)

* Initial release
